    <h1>Ben's Cybersecurity Stuff</h1>
    <p> Hi All.</p>
    <p>Chances are that you have arrived at this page as a result of hearing me speak about cyber safety online. This is the resources page.</p>
    <p>It's nothing fancy, but it's easy to maintain. Below you will find stuff related to presentations and extra resources.</p>
    <h2>Presentation slides</h2>
    <p>Click the slide below to download my "Standard Presentation Deck"</p>

    <h2>Bookmarks</h2>
    <p>The bookmarks below are hosted on raindrop.io - a social bookmark manager.</p>
    <p>I recommend you clock the "More" link in the top right of the frame below to open the full page, which shows links by category too.</p>

    <h2>Other Stuff</h2>
    <p>Sometimes there are just other cool links that I want to place outside of the bookmarks. Here they are.</p>
